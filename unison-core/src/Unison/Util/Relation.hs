-- This implementation avoids using @"Set (a,b)"@ because
-- it it is necessary to search for an item without knowing both @D@ and @R@.
--
-- In "Set", you must know both values to search.
--
-- Thus, we have are two maps to updated together.
--
-- 1. Always be careful with the associated set of the key.
--
-- 2. If you union two relations, apply union to the set of values.
--
-- 3. If you subtract, take care when handling the set of values.
--
-- As a multi-map, each key is associated with a Set of values v.
--
-- We do not allow the associations with the 'empty' Set.
