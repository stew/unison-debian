# Forking and merging namespaces in `ucm`

The Unison namespace is a versioned tree of names that map to Unison definitions. You can change this namespace and fork and merge subtrees of it. Let's start by introducing a few definitions into a new namespace, `foo`:

```unison
x = 42
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      x : Nat

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    x : Nat

```
Let's move `x` into a new namespace, `master`:

```ucm
.> rename.term x master.x

  Done.

```
If you want to do some experimental work in a namespace without disturbing anyone else, you can `fork` it (which is a shorthand for `copy.namespace`). This creates a copy of it, preserving its history.

> __Note:__ these copies are very efficient to create as they just have pointers into the same underlying definitions. Create as many as you like.

Let's go ahead and do this:

```
.> fork master feature1
.> view master.x
.> view feature1.x

```

Great! We can now do some further work in the `feature1` branch, then merge it back into `master` when we're ready.

```unison
y = "hello"
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      y : Text

```
```ucm
  ☝️  The namespace .feature1 is empty.

.feature1> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    y : Text

.master> merge .feature1

  Here's what's changed in the current namespace after the
  merge:
  
  Added definitions:
  
    1. y : Text
  
  Tip: You can use `todo` to see if this generated any work to
       do in this namespace and `test` to run the tests. Or you
       can use `undo` or `reflog` to undo the results of this
       merge.

.master> view y

  y : Text
  y = "hello"

```
> Note: `merge src`, with one argument, merges `src` into the current namespace. You can also do `merge src dest` to merge into any destination namespace.

Notice that `master` now has the definition of `y` we wrote.

We can also delete the fork if we're done with it. (Don't worry, it's still in the `history` and can be resurrected at any time.)

```ucm
.> delete.namespace .feature1

  Removed definitions:
  
    1. y : Text
  
  Tip: You can use `undo` or `reflog` to undo this change.

To resurrect an old version of a namespace, you can learn its hash via the `history` command, then use `fork #namespacehash .newname`.

## Concurrent edits and merges

In the above scenario the destination namespace (`master`) was strictly behind the source namespace, so the merge didn't have anything interesting to do (Git would call this a "fast forward" merge). In other cases, the source and destination namespaces will each have changes the other doesn't know about, and the merge needs to something more interesting. That's okay too, and Unison will merge those results, using a 3-way merge algorithm.

> __Note:__ When merging nested namespaces, Unison actually uses a recursive 3-way merge, so it finds a different (and possibly closer) common ancestor at each level of the tree.

Let's see how this works. We are going to create a copy of `master`, add and delete some definitions in `master` and in the fork, then merge.

```ucm
.> fork master feature2

  Done.

```
Here's one fork, we add `z` and delete `x`:

```unison
z = 99
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      z : Nat

```
```ucm
.feature2> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    z : Nat

.feature2> delete.term x

  Name changes:
  
    Original         Changes
    1. feature2.x ┐  2. feature2.x (removed)
    3. master.x   ┘  
  
  Tip: You can use `undo` or `reflog` to undo this change.

```
And here's the other fork, where we update `y` and add a new definition, `frobnicate`:

```unison
master.y = "updated y"
master.frobnicate n = n + 1
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      master.frobnicate : Nat -> Nat
      master.y          : Text

```
```ucm
.> update

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    master.frobnicate : Nat -> Nat
  
  ⍟ I've updated these names to your new definition:
  
    master.y : Text
      (The old definition was also named feature2.y. I updated
      this name too.)

.> view master.y

  feature2.y : Text
  feature2.y = "updated y"

.> view master.frobnicate

  master.frobnicate : Nat -> Nat
  master.frobnicate n =
    use Nat +
    n + 1

```
At this point, `master` and `feature2` both have some changes the other doesn't know about. Let's merge them.

```ucm
.> merge feature2 master

  Here's what's changed in master after the merge:
  
  Added definitions:
  
    1. z : Nat
  
  Removed definitions:
  
    2. x : Nat
  
  Tip: You can use `todo` to see if this generated any work to
       do in this namespace and `test` to run the tests. Or you
       can use `undo` or `reflog` to undo the results of this
       merge.

```
Notice that `x` is deleted in the merged branch (it was deleted in `feature2` and untouched by `master`):

```ucm
.> view master.x

  ⚠️
  
  The following names were not found in the codebase. Check your spelling.
    master.x

```
And notice that `y` has the most recent value, and that `z` and `frobnicate` both exist as well:

```ucm
.> view master.y

  feature2.y : Text
  feature2.y = "updated y"

.> view master.z

  feature2.z : Nat
  feature2.z = 99

.> view master.frobnicate

  master.frobnicate : Nat -> Nat
  master.frobnicate n =
    use Nat +
    n + 1

```
