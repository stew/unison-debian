##### This transcript reproduces the failure to unlink documentation

```ucm:hide
.> builtins.merge
```

Step 1: code a term and documentation for it
```unison
x = 1
x.doc = [: I am the documentation for x:]
```

Step 2: add term and documentation, link, and check the documentation
```ucm
.> add
.> link x.doc x
.> docs x
```

Step 3: Oops I don't like the doc, so I will re-code it!
```unison
x.doc = [: I am the documentation for x, and I now look better:]
```

Step 4: I add it and expect to see it
```ucm
.> update
.> docs x
```
But I don't see an update, so from here on I am in panic mode and have no clue what I am doing!

Step 5: maybe re-link it?
```ucm
.> link x.doc x
```

Step 6: Great that seems to have worked but let me check just in case

```ucm
.> docs x
.> display 1
```

Step 7: I have been guided to check `display 1`, so now let's try and unlink to get rid of the second link. We can remove by number, or by hash:

```ucm
.> unlink 2 x
.> view 2
.> undo
.> unlink #v8f1hhvs57 x
```

We expect that after the `unlink`, the `docs` command now works as there's a single `Doc` again:

```ucm
.> docs x
```
