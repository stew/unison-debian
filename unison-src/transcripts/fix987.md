```ucm:hide
.> builtins.merge
```

First we'll add a definition:

```unison
ability DeathStar where
  attack : Text -> ()

spaceAttack1 x =
  y = attack "saturn"
  z = attack "neptune"
  "All done"
```

Add it to the codebase:

```ucm
.> add
```

Now we'll try to add a different definition that runs the actions in a different order. This should work fine:

```unison
spaceAttack2 x =
  z = attack "neptune"
  y = attack "saturn"
  "All done"
```

```ucm
.> add
```

Previously, this would fail because the hashing algorithm was being given one big let rec block whose binding order was normalized.
